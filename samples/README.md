This project includes various samples for `react-tea-cup`.

These samples were implemented to validate the approach and
test everything. They are not meant to be "good practises".

# Build / Run

    # make sure tea-cup is compiled
    cd react-tea-cup
    npm install
    npm run compile

    # build and run the samples
    cd samples
    npm install
    npm start

The samples app is made with `create-react-app`. See the scripts in `package.json`.
